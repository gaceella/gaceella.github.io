# POSIX Shell

> "The shell is both a programming language and a user interface."

## What is a Shell?
A shell is a program that lets users interact with the operating system. It takes your commands, runs them, and shows the results.  
Common shells include `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.

## What is a Script?
A script is a file that contains a series of shell commands. It automates tasks, like installing software or processing files.  
Shell scripts usually have `.sh` as their extension.

## What is POSIX Shell?
A shell that follows POSIX rules to make scripts work on any Unix system.  
Examples include `sh`, `dash`, and `ash`.

## Why Do We Use the POSIX Shell?
It helps us write scripts that are portable and work everywhere. It is great for system-level scripting.

### Role in Shell Scripting
- Acts as the standard base shell for writing portable scripts.
- Used in system scripts and cross-platform tools.

### Advantages:
-  Works on all Unix systems.  
-  Lightweight and fast.  
-  Very stable.

### Disadvantages:
-  No advanced features (like colors or autocomplete).  
-  Less beginner-friendly.  
-  Can be hard for complex tasks.

## Example

The code example of the POSIX Shell:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

echo "Welcome to POSIX SHELL."
mkdir -p posix_folder
touch posix_folder/hello.txt
```

> The default shell that is running in our Operating System is usually a POSIX shell like `sh` or `bash`.

The line `#!/bin/sh` tells the system to use the POSIX-compliant shell interpreter (usually a symbolic link to a minimal shell like `dash` or `bash` in POSIX mode) to run the script.  
It ensures the script runs with standard POSIX shell behavior, improving portability across Unix-like systems.

### Commands to Run the Code:

1. Save the script file as `posix_script.sh`.
2. Run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
chmod +x posix_script.sh
./posix_script.sh
```

A folder called `posix_folder` will be created, and inside it a file named `hello.txt`.

The POSIX shell provides a standard, portable way to write scripts across Unix-like systems.  
Mastering it ensures consistent behavior in diverse environments.
